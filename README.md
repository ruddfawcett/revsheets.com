##Ramblings

This is my first "major" website, and my first time truly working with PHP, MySQL, PDO, and other web technologies.  It is just vanilla PHP, Bootstrap, some JavaScript, and then just HTML and some (but little) custom CSS.

The website is ~~still up~~ now down, but looking back at it, it greatly needs to be refactored, updated, scaled, etc.  All of which **will not** be done.

ReviewSheets also does have an API, which was hosted at `api.revsheets.com`.  It's not protected or secure, but is only present in order to be accessed from my first iOS app, which was available on the App Store.

##TL;DR

###First ever website in PHP.  Not scalable, beginner code and logic, not 100% secure/safe, no PHP MVC pattern, just Bootstrap + Vanilla PHP.
